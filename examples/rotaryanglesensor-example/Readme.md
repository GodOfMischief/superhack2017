# Introduction
This is an analog module that returns the angle of the twisty bit (technical
terms only here). It's basically a potentiometer with some maths mapping
it's variable resistance to angles.

# Using the vibration sensor
Using a Grove cable, connect the rotary angle sensor to the 'ANALOG GROVE'
connector on the ESP32 board.
