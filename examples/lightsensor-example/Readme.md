# Introduction
This is an analog module that outputs a voltage proportional to the intensity
of light that it registers. The library allows you to obtain raw values which
can then be used to determine a threshold for a callback handler (allowing
you to run a function when the light levels exceed a certain point).

# Using the vibration sensor
Using a Grove cable, connect the vibration sensor to the 'ANALOG GROVE'
connector on the ESP32 board.
