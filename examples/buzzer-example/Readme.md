# Introduction
This is a digital module that makes annoying sounds using a square wave signal
(unlike nice sinusoidal signals usually used in audio). By adjusting the
frequency of this square wave, different pitched sounds can be produced.

# Using the vibration sensor
Using a Grove cable, connect the buzzer to the 'DIGITAL GROVE' connector on the
ESP32 board.
