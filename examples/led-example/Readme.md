# Introduction
This is a digital module that turns the LED on when you send a HIGH signal and
is off otherwise. The LED's brightness can be adjusted by using a screwdriver to
twist the potentiometer (variable resistor) labelled R2 on the blue circuit
board.

# Using the LED
Using a Grove cable, connect the LED to the 'DIGITAL GROVE' connector on the
ESP32 board.
