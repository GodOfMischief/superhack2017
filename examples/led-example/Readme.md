# Introduction
This is a digital module that turns the LED on when you send a HIGH signal and
is off otherwise. The LED's brightness can be adjusted by using a screwdriver to
twist the potentiometer (variable resistor) labelled R2 on the blue circuit
board.

# Using the LED
Using a Grove cable, connect the LED to the 'DIGITAL GROVE' connector on the
ESP32 board.

If you can't see the LED working or it's not as bright as you'd expect, it's
possible that the potentiometer isn't set correctly. Using a slotted/flathead
screwdriver (or anything else that's suitable) to adjust the orange dial on the
LED module until the brightness is suitable.
