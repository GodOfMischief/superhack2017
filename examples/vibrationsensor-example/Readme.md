# Introduction
This is a digital module that outputs a HIGH signal when vibrations (caused by
touching it, people walking nearby or anything else you can imagine) exceed a
particular level. This level can be adjusted by using a screwdriver to twist the
potentiometer (variable resistor) labelled R6 on the blue circuit board.

# Using the vibration sensor
Using a Grove cable, connect the vibration sensor to the 'DIGITAL GROVE'
connector on the ESP32 board.
