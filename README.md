# Superhack2017

Superhack is organised by MUEEC (Melbourne University Electrical Engineering Club) and CISSA (Computing and Information Systems Students' Association) aiming at high school girls to promote women in tech.

We would like to thank our sponsors: IBM, Bosch, Deloitte, Github, Tekt Industries, Microsoft, Salesforce and Melbourne School of Engineering for their support.

We will be using IBM BlueMix & Node Red, with a custom Tekt Board connecting to a variety of sensors.

This repo will be updated with the basic tutorials for the aforementioned technologies as we get closer to the event!
