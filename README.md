# Superhack2017

Superhack is organised by MUEEC (Melbourne University Electrical Engineering Club) and CISSA (Computing and Information Systems Students' Association) aiming at high school girls to promote women in tech.

We would like to thank our sponsors: IBM, Bosch, Deloitte, Github, Tekt Industries, Microsoft, Salesforce and Melbourne School of Engineering for their support.

This year theme is Superheroes. We will be using IBM BlueMix, Tekt Board connecting with Rasberry Pi.

This repo contains the basic tutorials for the aforementioned technologies.
